# FizzBuzz
This is an implementation of the famous interview quiz, called FizzBuzz, which is also a real game played by two people.
There are two implementations of FizzBuzz as java methods : My first and second try.

fizzbuzzFirstTry()
has one reduntant if

fizbuzzWOW()
removed the reduntant if
utilized string concatanation... Fizz+Buzz=FizzBuzz obviously
used one line if statements
added a variable that controls the output.

There are improvements that can be made like a faster equals() function. or isEmpty? maybe
I won't bother with asking user, the limit of for loop... only 1..100.
